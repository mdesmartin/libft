# Libft

ft_libft is a custom C library created as part of the 42 school curriculum. The library provides a comprehensive set of functions that replicate and extend the functionality of standard C library functions. It serves as a fundamental building block for future programming projects, offering a wide range of utility functions that assist in various tasks.

The primary objective of ft_libft is to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms by implementing commonly used functions from scratch. By writing your own versions of these functions, you gain insight into their inner workings and learn important programming concepts.

## Key Features:

- String manipulation: ft_libft includes functions for manipulating strings, such as copying, concatenating, comparing, and searching.
- Memory management: The library provides memory allocation and deallocation functions, along with utilities for copying and setting memory blocks.
- Character handling: ft_libft offers functions for character classification, conversion, and manipulation, including checking alphanumeric characters, converting characters to uppercase or lowercase, and more.
- Linked list operations: The library includes functions to create, modify, and traverse linked lists, allowing you to work with dynamic data structures efficiently.
- Additional utilities: ft_libft also provides various additional functions, such as mathematical operations, file I/O, and error handling.

*By utilizing ft_libft in your projects, you can focus on the higher-level logic and algorithmic aspects, knowing that the basic functionality is already implemented reliably. Additionally, using your own library instead of relying solely on standard library functions allows you to have greater control and customization in your code.*

**Note:** This library was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and is intended for educational purposes. While it aims to provide comprehensive functionality, it is not meant to be a direct replacement for the standard C library.
